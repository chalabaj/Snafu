AK Belyaev, The Journal of Chemical Physics 147, 234301 (2017); **doi:10.1063/1.5000718**


## Status
The code is in **development** stage with no guarantees of its accuracy, precision or fitness. 

* Energy conservation from tests is about 10^-4 - 10^-1 eV between hops  and 10^-5 eV for the regions without hops. 

* Velocity adjustment after hops seems to be more stable when the velocities are scaled by the simple factor K = sqrt(1+-dE/Ekin), where dE is difference between potential energies, for which the hop occured, and Ekin is the kinetic energy at the moment of a hop. Another option is to apply new forces of the final state after hop, however, this requires extra calculations of the forces and the energy conservation appears to be less stable.

* Timestep of 4 au appears to be most suitable for hopping algorithm, but that depend on the PES complexity and some testing is always recommended as to minimize the number of hops. Timestep between 2-8 au should be sufficient.

* Hops are only allowed for pot. energy differences with less than 0.5 eV by default. Higher energy transitions generally lead to poor energy conservation.


## How to run
1) System requirements:
The code was tested on Linux/Debian 4.7.2-5 platform and Anaconda 3.6 package. MPI parallel environment for TeraChem-1.9 point-to-point communication was tested with mpich-3.1.3 and mpi4py-3.0.0. Mpi4py module has to be build with the same mpich as Terachem. 

1) **ABINITIO** folder has to contain one of the .sh script from INTERFACES folder or a terachem input file (or you can add your own interface, see below) .  
Option **abinitio** in input.in must equal to the name of the interface script (e.g. abinitio = molpro-casscf.sh). Interface file script ABINITIO/molpro-casscf.sh must exist. Same apply to terachem input file.
Currently fully working:  
CASSCF in MOLPRO (2015.1)  
ORCA(4.0.1): tddft -  working  
GAUSSIAN 09: tdddft - working (thresh needs to be set otherwise some tddft vectors might not fully converge and still gaussian exits with 0 - weird)
BOMD: MP2 in gaussian or MOLPRO  
TERACHEM: works through FMS interface, testing

TODO: EOM-IP, EOM-EA in QCHEM/ORCA,  
** New abinitio interface **
It is straight forward to implement a new ab initio interface as the code reads the gradients.dat file at each step. This file is created by an interface script after an ab-initio code completes ES calculations. It simply greps energies and gradients to gradients.dat file in a running directory with the following structure:  
energy-gs  
energy-1ex state  
....  
energy-nstate  
Fx(1at) Fy(1at) Fz(1at)  
....  
Fx(n_at) Fy(n_at) Fz(n_at)  

3) In order to run the code, **geom.in** with the initial geometry and **input.in** files have to present in a running folder.
The **veloc.in*** file with initial velocities is not mandatory. If there are no initial velocities, a simulation will start with zero velocities.
The geom.in and veloc.in files have to be in the XYZ format. Positions are in **ANGSTROM** units (so you can modify it with e.g. molden), but velocities have to be in **ATOMIC** units:  
Examples of water molecule in geom.in:
3  
water molecule in angstorm units
 O     0.000000     0.000000     0.000000
 H     0.000000     0.000000     0.947000
 H     0.892841     0.000000    -0.315663  

4) Launching:
The LAUNCHER folder contains launchSNAFU and SNAFUS bash scripts which will start the simulation. These are customized for Linux cluster-type computers with queuing systems (e.g. SGE, PBS). 
The launchSNAFU is not needed when running directly without queuing, however, SNAFUS scripts must be adjusted as it takes SGE queuing parameters like JOB_ID env variable. 
The launcher:  
- submit the job to que
- export environment variables   
- create folder on scratch  
- start the simulation on scratch
- copy data back to folder

The code requires to find **SNAFU_DIR** variable in your environment (in python this is os.environ['SNAFU_DIR']). This variable points to the folder with the **snafu.py** file and **snafu** subfolder containing all the modules. The variable is exported in the SNAFUS launcher script and should be modified depending on where you keep the code. The same applies for Terachem/MPI which are also exported here.

If the launcher is not used, just export the **SNAFU_DIR** variable:
  <code>
   export SNAFU_DIR="path/to/snafu/dir"
  </code>
and then run the code:
 <code>
 python snafu.py
 </code>
 
Environment variables for particular ab-initio code are exported in the interfaces scripts and have to be adjusted to your machine environment (see interface scripts in INTERFACE folder).

## How to restart dynamics

You can restart dynamics from the last completed step or from the chosen step XX depending on how often you wrote restart file during the original simulation.  
The **restart.in** file contains all needed information from the last completed simulation step. Similarly, **restart_freq = XX** option sets the interval for writing a restart file (restart_freq = 100=> restart_100.in, restart_200.in,restart_300.in,...). To restart simulation, the **input.in** file should NOT be changed with an exception to extend the simulation time by increasing the **maxsteps** option.

* To restart simuluation from the last completed step, set **restart = 1** and restart.in file must be in executing folder.
* To restart simuluation from XX step, set **restart = XX** and restart_XX.in file must be in executing folder.
* No restart when **restart = 0**, but restart files are created.

If you restart from some step, existing restart files with the same name will be overwritten.
If you use launchSNAFU from LAUNCHER folder, all previous output files (i.e. movie.xyz, energies.dat, restart*.in files, input.in, state.dat, snafu.out, velocities.xyz and PES.dat) will be copied to the folder named **PREV_RUN${N}** where N depends on number of previous restarts (PREV_RUN0 folder contains original simulation data).


The output files are opened in the "append" mode. This will ensure the continuation of output files, however, the original files will rather be backed-up. This is important since the restart procedure trims the output files (except of the snafu.out) after XX step.

restart = 0                # N - restart from N-th step, restart_N.in must exist
                           # 1 - restart from the last completed step (i.e. restart.in)
                           # 0 - unset but writes restart information
restart_freq = 100         # writes restart_N.in file each N-th step, here N = 100 (100, 200, etc.) (default = 100)
write_freq = 100           # how often print output, (default 10)
tera_mpi = 0               # use Terachem abinitio interface via MPI (default OFF)
