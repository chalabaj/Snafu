!-for simple CASSCF, you don't need to modify anything below this

!-we need to get rid of the SAMC records in file 2 (input.wfu,restart file)
!-otherwise, the forces and NACME are wrong for the following reason
!-cpmscf will not rewrite itself it but ather write into following records
!-but the subsequent call to forces would read from old records -> wrong numbers
!-we use file 2 for forces and NACME due to df-casscf
